### Hi there 👋  I'm Aslı Tuzcuoğlu! 

🎮  I'm a passionate game developer with 9 years of experience in the industry. My journey began as a Unity developer, where I created various casual games, shooter games, and later expanded into hyper-casual games.

🎰  I transitioned into the casino gaming sector, developing slot, bingo, and jackpot games using Pixi.js. This experience taught me the importance of performance optimization and cross-platform compatibility.

💻  I then explored web development, working as a frontend developer using Vue.js to build strategy games and web applications. This period helped me deepen my understanding of modern web technologies and design systems.

🎯  Although the technologies I've used have evolved over the years, I've always remained within the gaming industry, and I'm very happy about that. I enjoy working across various technologies, but my area of expertise is HTML5 game development with Pixi.js. Throughout my career, I've worked across diverse genres including casino, strategy, hyper-casual, shooter, and casual games, always eager to explore new challenges.

🚀  I thrive on new projects and creative challenges. If you think I can help bring your vision to life, I'd love to hear from you. I'm always open to collaboration and excited to contribute to innovative projects.
