### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm AslÄ± TuzcuoÄŸlu! 

- ðŸŽ® I've been diving into adventures in the game development world for 8 years, and now I'm continuing this exciting journey alongside web development. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Unity ECS for my professional career.
- ðŸ”­ Also Iâ€™m currently working on a short-term project developing a cocktail game for multiplayer play. In the long term, working on a horror game.
- ðŸŒŸ I believe that games have the power to make the world a better place, and this belief motivates me every day!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, frontend development, or anything related to tech and gaming!
- ðŸš€ New projects and adventures always excite me! I'm ready to do my best to contribute meaningfully to the technology and gaming communities.

## Projects that Excite Me in General:
**Creative and Original Games**: Working with unique and original game ideas triggers my creativity and always excites me.

**Meaningful Social Projects**: Projects that benefit society, help people, or raise awareness are very valuable to me. Working on such projects offers the opportunity to make positive changes in the real world using technology.

**Design System**: Another area I'm passionate about is creating and implementing design systems. Establishing a comprehensive and consistent design language helps improve user experiences, which is incredibly exciting for me.

If you share the same beliefs or have a project in mind that we could collaborate on, feel free to reach out!
