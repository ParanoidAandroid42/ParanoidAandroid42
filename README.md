### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm AslÄ± TuzcuoÄŸlu! 

ðŸŽ® I've been exploring the world of game development for the past 8 years, and I continue this journey as an Indie Developer.
ðŸ’» In addition to game development, I'm also an expert frontend developer and love honing my skills in this area as well.
ðŸŒŸ I strongly believe that games have the potential to make the world a better place, and this belief fuels my passion every single day!
ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything about game development, frontend development, or anything related to tech and gaming!
ðŸš€ I'm always excited about new projects and adventures. I'm eager to make meaningful contributions to both the tech and gaming communities.

If you share the same beliefs or have a project in mind that we could collaborate on, feel free to reach out!
