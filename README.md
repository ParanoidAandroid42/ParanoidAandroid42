### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm AslÄ± TuzcuoÄŸlu! 

- ðŸŽ® I've been diving into adventures in the game development world for 8 years, and now I'm continuing this exciting journey alongside web development.
- ðŸŒŸ I believe that games have the power to make the world a better place, and this belief motivates me every day!
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Unreal Engine game engine and taking Game Design courses for my horror game, and I'm learning Unity ECS for my professional career.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, frontend development, or anything related to tech and gaming!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a short-term project developing a cocktail game for multiplayer play. In the long term, working on a horror game.
- ðŸš€ New projects and adventures always excite me! I'm ready to do my best to contribute meaningfully to the technology and gaming communities.

If you share the same beliefs or have a project in mind that we could collaborate on, feel free to reach out!
