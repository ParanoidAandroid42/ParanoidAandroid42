### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With 8 years of experience in game development and 4 years in frontend web development, I'm deeply passionate about the potential of gaming to make a positive impact. While I currently work primarily in frontend development professionally, I'm also dedicated to indie game projects on the side. 

I'm always excited about new challenges and opportunities to grow while contributing to the tech and gaming communities.
